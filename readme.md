# 🌐 Responsive Personal Portfolio Page (Using AI Tools)

This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website built using **HTML + CSS only**, following the Masai assignment guidelines.  
It showcases my profile, skills, internships, education, and contact details in a clean and modern layout.

## 🧠 AI Tool Used

For this assignment, I used **Lovable.dev** to generate an initial website template.  
After generating the template, I **manually edited, improved, and customized** the entire design according to Masai requirements.

## ✨ What I Edited Manually

After generating the initial code using Lovable.dev, I performed the following manual improvements:

- Rewrote the entire layout to match a modern portfolio design  
- Customized color theme  
- Improved the hero section, skills grid, and footer  
- Added animations and hover effects  
- Improved responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Replaced placeholder text with my real details  
- Cleaned and structured the entire CSS file  
- Ensured no frameworks were used  
- Ensured there is **no horizontal scroll on mobile**  
- Added semantic sections such as Header, Hero, About, Skills, Footer
